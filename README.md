# Contactbook
A contact book is a database used to store entries related to a person’s contacts like a phone number, email address, etc.
It is also known as the address book.


overview

Creating a contact book is a great project for someone who is at an intermediate level in Python.
Somehow this follows the use of data structures
and algorithms as we are going to add contacts to the book and find them using the person’s name.
 When creating a contacts book with Python, you need to design an algorithm that
 allows the user to record and find any person’s details.
 With a few modifications, you can use it as a project where you can implement
 the same algorithm on a database like MySQL to store the contacts.
 
 
 
Summary


While running the code, you need to add 3 contacts and then you will be asked to search for a contact.
Remember to use the person’s name as your search term and feel free to change the code to suit your needs.
